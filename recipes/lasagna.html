    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dried sheets of past</li>
      <li>Meat ragú</li>
      <li>Ricotta and mozzarella</li>
      <li>Fresh egg (optional)</li>
      <li>Spinach (optional)</li>
      <li>Bechamel and Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin by preparing the ragù (meat sauce). First, cut the pancetta into
        1/4" cubes. Chop the cubes and sauté them in a pan. In another pan, add
        3 Tbsp. oil or butter, the celery, carrot, and onion, and cook until
        soft. Add the ground beef and cook until well browned, 25-30 minutes.
        Add the wine and stir until it evaporates. Add the tomato purée, cover,
        and simmer slowly for around two hours, adding broth as needed. When
        nearly done, add 1/2 cup milk to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Season
        with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the lasagna sheets: Bring water to a boil in a large pot and add
        salt. Boil and purée the spinach. Mix 2 2/3 cups flour, eggs and spinach
        into a compact dough. Roll into thin sheets (1/16") and cut into large
        rectangles. Line a tray with clean tea towels. Boil the pasta sheets
        until just softened (around 20 seconds) and transfer to the tea towels
        to dry.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F.</li>
      <li>
        For the béchamel: In a saucepan, heat 1/2 cup butter over low heat, add
        1 cup sifted flour, and whisk constantly. Cook this roux until golden,
        then add 1 qt. milk, salt, and nutmeg. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease a 9"x13" baking dish with butter and top with a layer of the
        lasagna sheets, then a layer of sauce, then the béchamel, and top with
        spoonful of Parmigiano. Repeat process until the ingredients are
        finished. Cover the final layer with béchamel, pats of butter, and bake
        for around 30 minutes. When the top is golden, remove and serve.

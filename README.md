The Odin Project Fundamentals HTML #1 Project Repo

Tue 8 Oct
In this GitHub repository I will create a simple web project using HTML first, then add CSS and possibly finish with a touch of JavaScript.

I will also be training version control by using Git and the command line on my Mac.

This project is part of The Odin Project Fundamentals Course
